The Simple Factory pattern is a commonly used simplified means of delegating the instantiation of objects to a specific class (the 
factory). Some authors state that Simple Factory is more of an object oriented programming idiom rather than a full-fledged pattern. 

abstract class Gearbox

public class GearboxFactory {
  public enum Type { AUTOMATIC, MANUAL}; 
  public static Gearbox create(Type type) { ... }
}

public class AutomaticGearbox extends Gearbox

public class ManualGearbox extends Gearbox

in Client: 
             Gearbox auto = GearboxFactory.create(GearboxFactory.Type.AUTOMATIC);
             Gearbox manual = GearboxFactory.create(GearboxFactory.Type.MANUAL);
